<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of BEAM is to identify genes that have multiple genomic
features associated with multiple clinical endpoints. It uses simple
association models and bootstraping to integrate multiple genomic
features.

## Installation

You can install the development version of BEAM from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("annaSeffernick/BEAM")
```

## Example

Add example later.
